# Database of images from the Swedish sign language.

To add new images, just add them to the folder with the corresponding name (if it doesn't exist, create it).

It would help if the images were labeled with their letter and the next free number, e.g: if the images R_1 and R_2 already exist, the images should be labeled R_3
